"How-to" guides
===============

Here you'll find short answers to "How do I....?" types of questions. These
how-to guides don't cover topics in depth -- you'll find that material in the
:ref:`topics-index` and the :ref:`ref-index`. However, these guides will help
you quickly accomplish common tasks.
